TODO 1: Predict Venezuela life satisfaction value by a model based learning (Linear Regression, LinearRegression) method

In the scatter plot you get, show Venezuela in a different color.*
Print the LifeSatisfaction value you obtaine.*
Plot the LinearRegression function that fits the data.*
 

TODO 2: Predict Venezuela life satisfaction value by using a K-Nearest Neighbour Regression (KNeighborsRegressor, KNN) instance based learning method

In the scatter plot you get, show Venezuela in a different color.*
Print the LifeSatisfaction value you obtaine.*
Observe what happens when you increase the "K" parameter in KNN, show and discuss your results on a notebook.

 

TODO 3: Predict Venezuela life satisfaction value by using Polynomial Regression Fitting.

In the scatter plot you get, show Venezuela in a different color.*
Print the LifeSatisfaction value you obtaine.*
Plot the polynomial function that fits the data.*


#project two
The aim of this assignment is to use Ensemble Learning to solve a problem. In this way, it is aimed to understand the benefits of Ensemble Learning and to teach the usage details of different ensemble approaches with the help of ScikitLearn library. 

The following methods will be implemented within the scope of this assignment. These are:
- Voting Classifier (hard & soft voting)

-Voting classifier in Scikit-Learn Train voting classifiers in Scikit-Learn, composed of at least three diverse classifiers

- Bagging/Pasting

- Out-of-bag (oob) classifier

- Random forest classifier

Note: This is the legendary Titanic ML competition the best of [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/),  first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works. Let's go to the [Titanic challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
​
The data is already split into a training set and a test set. However, the test data does *not* contain the labels: your goal is to train the best model you can using the training data, then make your predictions on the test data and REPORT your final score.
​
The goal is to predict whether or not a passenger survived based on attributes such as their age, sex, passenger class, where they embarked and so on.
